How to build OpenSCAD with Emscripten
=====================================


Step 0 - Install Emscripten and set environment variables.
	Follow the instructions at http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
	If you haven't already, `source emsdk_env.sh` as usual.

Step 1 - Make a directory for doing out-of-source build.
	`mkdir build && cd build`

Step 2 - Get the build dependencies for the host system (note: might not be necessary, but it's safe!)
	`sudo /PATH/TO/OPENSCAD/scripts/uni-get-dependencies.sh`

Step 3 - Set the environment variables
	`. /PATH/TO/OPENSCAD/scripts/setenv-emscriptenbuild.sh`

Step 4 - Begin building!
	`. /PATH/TO/OPENSCAD/scripts/emcc-build-dependencies.sh`

Step 5 - Continue building as usual?
	`qmake`
	`make`
